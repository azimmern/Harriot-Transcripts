Those marked with asterisks in the upper part of the table can be calculated as reciprocals of those in the lower part. The numbers in the narrow left-hand column, above the horizontal dividing line, form an increasing arithmetic progression with common difference 512. (In the narrow right-hand column, part of the same progression is shown in reverse order.) Thus Harriot has matched an arithmetic progression with common difference 512 to a geometric progression with common ratio $ \frac{1}{{10}^{\frac{1}{16}}} $. The matching continues in finer detail below the dividing line for the entries in the geometric progression between $ 11.5478... $ and $ 10 $. Such a matching, between an arithmetic progression and a geometric progression, is the foundation of any system of logarithms. Harriot notes that calculating the numbers in the central column as terms in a geometric progression can lead to differences in the final figures as compared with calculating them as square roots. The number $ 31,622... $ halfway down the column is written here as it was found by calculation in Add MS 6782 f. 7 , with the final figures $ ... 683,79 $.

The first row shows the total if the interest is paid yearly (7 payments). The second row shows the total if interest is paid twice a year (14 payments). The third row shows the total if interest is paid three times a year (21 payments). From here, Harriot immediately generalizes to $ n $ payments per year. He then (implicitly) allows $ n $ to become very large, indeed infinitely large, so that the fractions $ \frac{(n - 1)n}{nn} $, $ \frac{(n - 2)(n - 1)n}{nnn} $, ... can all be taken to be 1. Harriot then substitutes $ b = 10 $ to obtain the interest on £100 at a rate of $ \frac{1}{10} $, paid continuously over seven years. The total comes to £201 7 shillings and 6 pence, plus a further fraction that he estimates is not quite $ \frac{7}{100} $ pence. (There were 20 shillings (s) to £1, and 12 pence (d) to 1 shillling.)

At the top is the sequence 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, ... of sums of squares (or of square-pyramidal numbers, see Add MS 6782 f. 155 ).

Putting $ a = 1 $ gives $ 2 + 9 + 11 + 2 $, as required. Putting $ a = 2 $, however, gives $ 2 \times 16 + 9 \times 8 + 11 + 4 + 2 \times 4 = 152 $, which is too large.

For Stifel, a diagonal number was obtained by multiplying the first two entries of a Pythagorean triple. The diagonal number corresponding to the triple (3, 4, 5), for example, is $ 3 \times 4 = 12 $. Stifel also defined Pythagorean triples by the ratio of the two shorter sides, in this case $ \frac{4}{3} $. He was able to write out two lists, or orders, of triples, one with the shorter side odd ($ \frac{4}{3} $, $ \frac{12}{5} $, and so on), the other with the shorter side even ($ \frac{15}{8} $, $ \frac{35}{12} $, and so on). Stifel claimed that all possible triples were included in these two orders. The second reference in the heading, possibly added a little later, is to Johannes Praetorius (Johann Richter), Problema, quod iubet ex quatuor rectis lineis datis quadrilaterum fieri, quod sit in circulo (Praetorius 1598) . On the final page, Praetorius discusses the problem of constructing cyclic quadrilaterals with rational sides. Harriot sets out to disprove Stifel's claim, by demonstrating the existence of new orders of triples. His first order (ordo. 1.) is the same as Stifel's first order. The triples are set out in three columns with differences calculated between rows. This allows Harriot to extrapolate forwards, but also backwards to a starting triple (1, 0, 1). The second order (ordo. 2.) is the same as Stifel's second order. Again the triples are set out in three columns with differences calculated between rows. As for the first order this allows Harriot to extrapolate backwards to a starting triple (4, 3, 5). This is the first triple of the first order with the first two entries interchanged. Perhaps this gave Harriot the idea of interchanging other pairs. Thus he begins a third and new order (ordo. 3. novus) with (12, 5, 8), which is the second triple from the first order with the first two entries interchanged. This order immediately contains (20, 21, 29), which was not included in either of Stifel's orders. The fourth order begins with (15, 8, 17), which is the first triple from the second order with the first two entries interchanged. And so on. By the end of the page, Harriot has six orders, with differences in the left column of 2, 4, 8, 6, 10, 12, respectively. This seems to suggest to him a more systematic method of displaying the orders, which he goes on to do on the next page.

These are also the pentagonal-pyramidal numbers 1, 6, 18, ... as calculated in Add MS 6782 f. 156 . Successive sums of these numbers are shown in the column to the left headed $ S $ (for sum). Successive differences are shown in the columns to the right. In the upper right table, the key column is the one beneath the sketch of a cube. The numbers beneath the sketch are the cube numbers, which can also be thought of (in keeping with the previous table) as the numbers needed to construct square prisms with height equal to one side of the base: $ 1 = 1 \times 1 $, $ 8 = 2 \times 4 $, $ 27 = 3 \times 9 $, and so on. Successive sums are shown in the column to the left headed $ S $ (for sum). Successive differences are shown in the columns to the right. The column beginning 1, 7, 19, 37, ... is marked 'hexagonae equianguliÕ (equiangled hexagons); it is possible that at first glance Harriot mistook this column for the the hexagonal-pyramidal numbers 1, 7, 22, 50, .... In the lower left table, the key column is the one beneath the sketch of a pentagonal prism. The numbers beneath the sketch are the numbers needed to construct pentagonal prisms with length equal to one side of the base: $ 1 = 1 \times 1 $, $ 10 = 2 \times 5 $, $ 36 = 3 \times 12 $, and so on.

Successive sums are shown in the column headed to the left headed $ S $ (for sum). Successive differences are shown in the columns to the right.

In Book X; Definitions II , Euclid defined six kinds of binomes, according to various relationships of $ m $ to $ n $, which for Euclid were geometric lengths. In modern notation, the six binomes may be defined as follows. Binome 1: a binome of the form $ m + \sqrt{n} $ with $ m > \sqrt{n} $, and $ m^2 = n + k $ where $ \frac{m}{\sqrt{k}} $ is rational; for example $ 7 + \sqrt{48} $. Binome 2: a binome of the form $ \sqrt{m} + n $ with $ \sqrt{m} > n $, and $ m = n^2 + k $ where $ \frac{\sqrt{m}}{\sqrt{k}} $ is rational; for example $ \sqrt{12} + 3 $. Binome 3: a binome of the form$ \sqrt{m} + \sqrt{n} $ with $ \sqrt{m} > \sqrt{n} $, and $ m = n + k $ where $ \frac{\sqrt{m}}{\sqrt{k}} $ is rational; for example $ \sqrt{8} + \sqrt{6} $. Binome 4: a binome of the form $ m + \sqrt{n} $ with $ m > \sqrt{n} $, and $ m^2 = n + k $ where $ \frac{m}{\sqrt{k}} $ is non-rational; for example $ 2 + \sqrt{2} $. Binome 5: a binome of the form $ \sqrt{m} + n $ with $ \sqrt{m} > n $, and $ m = n^2 + k $ where $ \frac{\sqrt{m}}{\sqrt{k}} $ is non-rational; for example $ \sqrt{2} + 1 $. Binome 6: a binome of the form $ \sqrt{m} + \sqrt{n} $ with $ \sqrt{m} > \sqrt{n} $, and $ m = n + k $ where $ \frac{\sqrt{m}}{\sqrt{k}} $ is non-rational; for example $ \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{2} $. Harriot made two further distinctions for binomes of the fifth and sixth kind according to whether $ k $ is itself a square (type i) or not (type (ii). In this and the following folio, Add MS 6782 f. 268 , Harriot shows that the square of any binome is always a binome of the first kind.

Such equations have one, and only one, positive root. The work is closely based on Problems 1 to 6 of Vite's De numerosa potestatum ad exegesin resolutione (Viete 1600b) ; Harriot's heading 'De numerosa potestatum resolutione' directly echoes Vite's. The method works by finding each digit of the root in turn. Suppose that a required root $ a $ of is of the form $ b + c $, where $ b $ represents multiples of 10 and $ c $ represents units. The first digit is found by inspection. The canonical form then shows how to estimate $ c $. In the problem on this page, for example, Harriot first takes $ b $ to be 40, but quickly finds that this is too large. Therefore $ b $ must be 30. Subtracting the known values of $ bb $ (= 900) and $ bd $ (= 720) from 2356 leaves him with 736, which according to the canonical form must correspond to $ 2bc + cd + cc $. A first estimate for $ c $ is found by dividing 736 by $ 2b + d $ (= 84). The integer part of the quotient is 8. In fact $ c = 8 $ satisfies the equation $ 2bc + cd + cc = 736 $ exactly and so the process is complete. Later examples become more complicated but follow the same basic procedure.

Such equations have two positive roots. It is therefore important to know the relative sizes of the roots before beginning extraction by numerical methods. This is the problem Harriot investigated in this section. The work is closely based on Problems 16 to 20 in Vite, De numerosa potestatum ad exegesin resolutione, (Viete 1600b) . Vite gave rules for finding the second positive root once the first is known, but without explanation. In this section, Harriot fills in the missing details, showing how the two positive roots are related to the coefficients of the original equation and to each other.
