Across the top of the page are the terms of a geometric progression with multiplier $ \frac{a}{b} $. 

The rest of the page contains a table of successive squares of the number that may be interpreted as $ .99999999998877 $. 
Selected powers are then added to give $ .99999999998877^{25920000} $. 
A calculation on the following page, Add MS 6782

(where a degree is subdivided in the traditional way into minutes, seconds, thirds, fourths, and fifths by successive divisions by 60). 

The entries in the table are calculated in the subsequent pages labelled c.2 to c.7; see:

  The calculation in the upper left corner shows the number of seconds, thirds, fourths, and fifths in a minute of a degree.  
  The number of fifths (12960000) is then doubled to give the number of half-fifths (25920000). 
  
  In the upper right corner, Harriot calculates that if 1 minute is represented by 1 mile, 
  a half-fifth of a degree would be represented by $ \frac{1}{432} $ of an inch, a distance that, as he observes,

The numbers in the broad central column, above the horizontal dividing line, form a decreasing geometric progression. 
Harriot used large integers to avoid fractional parts, but if the first number is interpreted as 100, 
the succeeding numbers down to the dividing line represent 
$ 10 \times {10}^{\frac{15}{16}} $, $ 10 \times {10}^{\frac{14}{16}} $, $ 10 \times {10}^{\frac{13}{16}} $, ... 
$ 10 \times {10}^{\frac{2}{16}} $, $ 10 \times {10}^{\frac{1}{16}} $, $ 10 \times {10}^0 $. 
The numbers below the dividing line may be interpreted in a similar way as 
$ 10 \times {10}^{\frac{1}{32}} $, $ 10 \times {10}^{\frac{1}{64}} $, $ 10 \times {10}^{\frac{1}{1128}} $, ... 
$ 10 \times {10}^{\frac{1}{2048}} $, $ 10 \times {10}^{\frac{1}{4096}} $, $ 10 \times {10}^{\frac{1}{8192}} $. 
The numbers marked with asterisks from $ 31.622... $ downwards have been calculated as successive square roots 
in sheets paginated fb.1 to fb.6, in Add MS 6782 
 
to 
. 
Those marked with asterisks in the upper part of the table can be calculated as reciprocals of those in the lower part. 
The numbers in the narrow left-hand column, above the horizontal dividing line, form an increasing arithmetic progression 
with common difference 512. (In the narrow right-hand column, part of the same progression is shown in reverse order.) 
Thus Harriot has matched an arithmetic progression with common difference 512 
to a geometric progression with common ratio $ \frac{1}{{10}^{\frac{1}{16}}} $. 
The matching continues in finer detail below the dividing line for the entries in the geometric progression between 
$ 11.5478... $ and $ 10 $. Such a matching, between an arithmetic progression and a geometric progression, is the 
foundation of any system of logarithms. 
Harriot notes that calculating the numbers in the central column as terms in a geometric progression 
can lead to differences in the final figures as compared with calculating them as square roots. 
The number $ 31,622... $ halfway down the column is written here as it was found by calculation in Add MS 6782 
, 
with the final figures $ ... 683,79 $. Calculating the same entry by multiplication, as part of a geometric progression, 
has instead given Harriot the final figures as $ ... 683,76 $. Similar discrepancies are noted elsewhere.

This folio shows combinations (without repetition) of $ a $, $ ab $, $ abc $, $ abcd $, 
with each list constructed from the previous one. 
Combinations of $ abcd $, for example, are found from combinations of $ abc $ 
by adding $ d $ to each of them, together with $ d $ as a singleton. 
Numbers to the right of each column show the number of combinations in each part of the list. 
Totals are given at the bottom. 
Harriot uses the word 'complications' for combinations of more than one letter, 
and 'simples' for single letters. 
At the end of the page Harriot reaches the conclusion that if null combinations are counted, 
then the total number of combinations will be a power of 2.

On this page, as on Add MS 6782 
, Harriot recognizes the usefulness of the triangular numbers 
both for calculating numbers of combinations and for extraction of roots. 
In the note in the bottom right hand corner of the page, Harriot mentions Boethius, Jordanus, and Maurolico 
as writers on figurate numbers. 
His source for both Boethius and Jordanus was probably Jacques Lefevre d'Etaples (Jacob Faber Stapulensis), 
 (1503, 1522), 
which includes a comparison of the 'De institutione' of Boethius with the 'De arithmetica' of Jordanus. 
His source for Maurolico was the  
,  
which he cited several times elsewhere.

The two words 'on dice' in the title are written in Harriot's Algonquin alphabet 
(see Add MS 6782 
). 
The two tables at the top of the page show the sums that can be obtained on 
(i) two dice (sums ranging from 2 to 12) or (ii) three dice (sums ranging from 3 to 18). 
The three tables in the lower part of the page are frequency tables for the sums on
(iii) two dice;  (iv) three dice ; (v) four dice. 
Tables (iii) and (iv) can be calculated directly from (i) and (ii). 
However, the layout shows that (iv) can also be calculated by taking copies of the totals from (iii), 
staggering their starting position, and then adding; 
this is equivalent to taking the totals from (iii) 
and then adding 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, in turn to represent the throw of the third dice. 
For each of (iii), (iv), and (v) the most likely sums are marked with a small cross.

This folio appears to deal with 6 dice numbered as follows: 

first die: 0 0 0 0 0 1 
second die: 0 0 0 0 0 2 
third die: 0 0 0 0 0 3 
fourth die: 0 0 0 0 0 4 
fifth die: 0 0 0 0 0 5 
sixth die: 0 0 0 0 0 6 

The tables show the possible outcomes of throwing the first, then the first and the second, 
then the first and the second and the third, and so on. 
In the table for six dice, for example, we see that combinations with one 0 and five other numbers 
can appear in $ 5 \times 6 = 30 $ ways (since any of the five zeros can appear in any of the six positions). 
Squeezed below and between the main tables are frequency tables showing how many times each sum can appear. 
For six dice, for example, we see that the total 3 can arise in two ways (as 1 + 2 or as 0 + 3) 
giving 3,750 possibilities in total. 
In each of these tables the number of possibilities is summed, giving the appropriate power of 6 in each case.

The tables on this folio appear to have been begun at the top left 
but then re-started and continued along the right-hand edge. 
The tables are calculated in turn for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 throws of a die. 
Take, for example, the fourth table, for four throws of a die. 
The first row indicates that the combination 1111 can occur in only one way. 
The next two rows indicate how many ways only 1 and 2 can occur, distributed as either  
3 + 1  (thus, 1112, 1121, 1211, 2111, 2221, 2212, 2122, 1222), that is, $ 2 \times 4 = 8 $ ways in total, 
or as
2 + 2 (thus, 1122, 1212, 1221, 2112, 2121, 2211), that is, 3 + 3 = 6 ways in total. 
These two calculations are shown in full on Add MS 6782 
. 
The fourth row indicates how many ways only 1, 2, and 3 can occur, 
with any one of them appearing twice (thus 1123, 1132, 1212, 3112, ...), that is, 
$ 4 \times 3 \times 3 = 36 $ ways in total.
Further details of the calculation are shown on Add MS 6782 
. 
The fifth and final row indicates how many ways 1, 2, 3, 4 can appear, that is, 
$ 1 \times 2 \times 3 \times 4 = 24 $ ways in total. 
All the other tables are calculated in a similar way. 
Several of the calculations can be seen on Add MS 6782 
. 
Below the line (still reading the page sideways) are two further tables; 
for the continuation of these, see Add MS 6782 
. 
Harriot also includes some brief notes to explain how the tables have been derived.

On this folio Harriot uses the totals he has arrived at on Add MS 6782 
, 
but now extends the calculations to all six numbers on the die. 
As for Add MS 6783, f. 49, we will once again examine the fourth table. 
The first row indicates that a given number can be appear four times in just one way; 
but the given number can be chosen in six ways, so there are $ 1 \times 6 = 6 $ such combinations in total. 
The second row indicates that any two numbers can occur together, with 3 of one and 1 of the other, in 8 ways 
(as calculated on Add MS 6783 
,); 
but two numbers can be chosen from six in 15 ways ($ \frac{6 \times 5}{2 \times 1} $), 
so there are $ 8 \times 5 = 120 $ such combinations in total. 
The third row indicates that any two numbers can occur together, with 2 of one and 2 of the other, in 6 ways 
(as calculated on Add MS 6783 
,); 
but two numbers can be chosen from six in 15 ways ($ \frac{6 \times 5}{2 \times 1} $), 
so there are $ 6 \times 15 = 90 $ such combinations in total. 
The fourth row indicates that any three numbers can occur together in 36 ways 
(as calculated on Add MS 6783 
,); 
but three numbers can be chosen from six in 20 ways ($ \frac{6 \times 5 \times 4}{3 \times 2 \times 1} $), 
so there are $ 36 \times 20 = 720 $ such combinations in total. 
The fifth row indicates that any four numbers can occur together in 24 ways 
(as calculated on Add MS 6783 
,); 
but four numbers can be chosen from six in 15 ways ($ \frac{6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3}{4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1} $), 
so there are $ 24 \times 15 = 360 $ such combinations in total. 
As a check on the calculations, Harriot has calculated powers of 6 on the same page. 
It is easily seen from this that each table includes all the possibilities for that number of throws.

In this page. Harriot begins by constructing a table of the interest paid after seven years 
on a capital sum of £$ bb $ at an annual rate of $ \frac{1}{b} $. 
The first row shows the total if the interest is paid yearly (7 payments).  
The second row shows the total if interest is paid twice a year (14 payments). 
The third row shows the total if interest is paid three times a year (21 payments). 
From here, Harriot immediately generalizes to $ n $ payments per year. 
He then (implicitly) allows $ n $ to become very large, indeed infinitely large, 
so that the fractions $ \frac{(n - 1)n}{nn} $, $ \frac{(n - 2)(n - 1)n}{nnn} $, ... can all be taken to be 1. 
Harriot then substitutes $ b = 10 $ to obtain the interest on £100 at a rate of $ \frac{1}{10} $, 
paid continuously over seven years. The total comes to £201 7 shillings and 6 pence, 
plus a further fraction that he estimates is not quite $ \frac{7}{100} $ pence. 
(There were 20 shillings (s) to £1, and 12 pence (d) to 1 shillling.) 
This page combines the calculations on the nearby 
 
(interest on £$ b $ at an annual rate of $ \frac{1}{b} $, paid at decreasing intervals) 
with those on 
 
(interest on £100 at an annual rate of $ \frac{1}{10} $ paid at decreasing intervals and taken to a limit.

After the rough work crossed out at the top, 
the table show the calculation of interest on £100 at an annual rate of $ \frac{1}{10} $, 
paid every year for five years. 
The next section is crossed out but the reader is referred by asterisk to an expression lower down the page. 
Here Harriot has written a general formula for the interest paid on £100 
at an annual rate of $ \frac{1}{10} $ after $ n $ years. 
In the next calculation Harriot has assumed that $ n $ is infinitely large, 
so that the fractions $ \frac{(n - 1)n}{nn} $, $ \frac{(n - 2)(n - 1)n}{nnn} $, ... can all be taken to be 1. 
Thus he obtains the interest on £100 at an annual rate of $ \frac{1}{10} $ paid continuously. 
In calculating the sum, Harriot has drawn a vertical line that cuts off the calculation after 6 terms. 
He notes underneath that £$ \frac{1}{60} = 4 $d (4 pence), that £$ \frac{1}{2400} = \frac{1}{10}$d, 
and that the sum of all the remaining terms will not make up as much as $ \frac{2}{10} $d.

At the beginning of this set of sheets Harriot has written: 'Waste papers of figurate nombers'. 
They are waste only in the sense that they contain rough working. At the same time, 
they show Harriot attempting something highly original, namely, 
finding formulae for sequences of figurate numbers. 
In modern terms, we would say he is fitting third-, fourth- or fifth-degree polynomials 
to numerical sequences. 

At the top is the sequence 1, 5, 14, 30, 55, ... of sums of squares  
(or of square-pyramidal numbers, see Add MS 6782 
).
Just below that, Harriot has written the polynomial $ 2aaaa + 9aaa + 11a + 2a $, which, it seems, 
is his first attempt to find a formula for the numbers in the sequence, multiplied by 24 
(that is, 24, 120, 336, ...). Putting $ a = 1 $ gives $ 2 + 9 + 11 + 2 $, as required. 
Putting $ a = 2 $, however, gives $ 2 \times 16 + 9 \times 8 + 11 + 4 + 2 \times 4 = 152 $, which is too large. 
This calculation can be seen displayed vertically just below the formula. 
Harriot notes that $ 6 \times 24 = 144 $ falls short of this total by 8. 
Similar trial and error calculations appear on this and several pages that follow.

Trials similar to those on Add MS 6782

for $ a = 5 $, giving $ 1680 = 24 \times 70 $; and (lower right) for for $ a = 2 $,

It seems Harriot is still trying to fit the sequence 1, 5, 14, 30, ...,

On this folio Harriot appears to be searchng for a formula for the sequence 1, 6, 20, 50, ... 
of sums of square-pyramidal numbers (see Add MS 6782

for those numbers multiplied 24, that is, 24, 144, 480, ... . 
Examples on the left hand side of the page test the polynomial $ 8a + 4aa + 10aaa + 2aaaa $ 
(note that 8 + 4 + 10 + 2 = 24). This is evaluated for $ a = 2 $, giving 144 (as required) 
and for $ a = 3 $, giving 492 (too large). 
Examples in the bottom left hand corner rearrange the same coefficients in different orders: 
(2, 10, 8, 4), (8, 10, 2, 4), (8, 2, 10, 4), etc. 
In examples further to the right, the fifth-degree polynomial $ 24a + 50aa + 35aaa + 10aaaa + aaaaa $, 
represented by the coefficients 24, 50, 35, 10, 1, is evaluated for $ a = 2 $, giving 640,

The first reference in the heading is to Michael Stifel's  
, page 15.   
For Stifel, a diagonal number was obtained by multiplying the first two entries of a Pythagorean triple. 
The diagonal number corresponding to the triple (3, 4, 5), for example, is $ 3 \times 4 = 12 $. 
Stifel also defined Pythagorean triples by the ratio of the two shorter sides, in this case $ \frac{4}{3} $. 
He was able to write out two lists, or orders, of triples, 
one with the shorter side odd ($ \frac{4}{3} $, $ \frac{12}{5} $, and so on), 
the other with the shorter side even ($ \frac{15}{8} $, $ \frac{35}{12} $, and so on). 
Stifel claimed that all possible triples were included in these two orders. 
The second reference in the heading, possibly added a little later, is to Johannes Praetorius (Johann Richter), 
 
. On the final page, 
Praetorius discusses the problem of constructing cyclic quadrilaterals with rational sides. 

Harriot sets out to disprove Stifel's claim, by demonstrating the existence of new orders of triples. 
His first order (ordo. 1.) is the same as Stifel's first order. 
The triples are set out in three columns with differences calculated between rows. 
This allows Harriot to extrapolate forwards, but also backwards to a starting triple (1, 0, 1). 
The second order (ordo. 2.) is the same as Stifel's second order. 
Again the triples are set out in three columns with differences calculated between rows. 
As for the first order this allows Harriot to extrapolate backwards to a starting triple (4, 3, 5). 
This is the first triple of the first order with the first two entries interchanged. 
Perhaps this gave Harriot the idea of interchanging other pairs. 
Thus he begins a third and new order (ordo. 3. novus) with (12, 5, 8), 
which is the second triple from the first order with the first two entries interchanged. 
This order immediately contains (20, 21, 29), which was not included in either of Stifel's orders.  
The fourth order begins with (15, 8, 17), 
which is the first triple from the second order with the first two entries interchanged. 
And so on. By the end of the page, Harriot has six orders, with differences in the left column of 2, 4, 8, 6, 10, 12, 
respectively. 
This seems to suggest to him a more systematic method of displaying the orders, 
which he goes on to do on the next page.

Throughout the treatise that follows, $ n $ is to be read as a positive integer. 
The table at the top of the page is an array of general triangular numbers: 
the first row and first column contain units, the second row and second column contain lengths, 
the third row and third column contain triangular numbers, the fourth row and fourth column contain pyramidal numbers, 
and so on. 
Between the numbers are signs that combine 'plus' and 'equals', 
illustrating the additive property of the table. 
The numerators and denominators of the fractions are to be read as products. 
Thus $ \frac{789,10,11}{12345} $ in the bottom right-hand corner, for example, is to be read as 
$ \frac{7 \times 8 \times 9 \times 10 \times 11}{1 \times 2 \times 3 \times 4 \times 5} = 924 $.  
Below the tables Harriot has written general formulae for the numbers in the $ n $th row.

At the top of the page are two difference tables. 
In each case column headed $ g $ may be taken as the starting column. 
Column $ f $ contains successive differences between entries in column $ g $, and so on. 
As elsewhere, a triangle broadening downwards thus, Δ, indicates an increasing column. 
A small square is used to indicate columns of equal entries. 
The central table shows a difference table generated from a constant differenc $ a $. 
Now the lower case letters $ a $, $ b $, $ c $, $ d $, $ f $ represent the first entry of each column 
(the letter $ e $, which for Harriot represented an un unknown quantity, is omitted).  
Harriot has drawn a diagonal line under the table generated from a single entry

(Add MS 6782 
 to

for each pattern of increasing and decreasing columns, for up to six columns. 
The symbols above charts 1 and 32, which look rather like $ \sigma $ and $ \psi $, 
are Harriot's symbols for tangents and secants. 
The symbol $ \upsilon $ above tables 11 and 22 is his symbol for sines. In each case, 
the patterns of c and d columns are those required for the corresponding trigonometric tables.

On the right hand side of the page are three partial difference tables from earlier pages; 
the first and third tables are from page 10 (Add MS 6782 
) while the second is from page 11 (Add MS 6782 
). 
In each case, Harriot has also listed the first entries of the columns of the original difference table, 
denoted by $ a $, $ b $, $ c $, and $ d $. 
On the left hand side are algebraic versions of the same partial difference tables. 
The first table gives formulae for successive second entries 
of the column beginning with $ d $, together with successive differences. 
The second table gives formulae for successive third entries 
of the column beginning with $ d $, together with successive differences. 
The third table gives formulae for succesive $ n $th entries 
of the column beginning with $ d $.  
The final table shows the $ n $th-entry formulae multiplied out, 
with differences calculated between them. 
This demonstrates that the constant difference, 
in a table constructed from every $ n $th entry of the original table, is $ nnna $.

This folio contains a set of formulae for interpolating $ (n - 1) $ new terms between each pair of entries 
in the fourth column of a difference table (the $ D $ column). 
For reasons of space, Harriot has written the entries for the fourth column below those 
for the first, second, and third columns. 
At the bottom of the page, he has written a single general formula for the $ N $th interpolated term 
in the fourth column. This he calls the 'magisterium', which may here be translated as 'rule'. 
Since this formula is expressed entirely in terms of $ n $, $ N $, $ D $, $ C $, $ B $, and $ A $, 
he longer needs to compute $ a $, $ b $, and $ c $.

This page shows formulae analogous to the 'magisterium' on page 26 (Add MS 6782

but indicates that the expression to the left of it 
is the $ N $th entry of a table interpolated to $ n $ times its original length.

This folio contains the same formulae as page 33 (Add MS 6782

but with $ \frac{N}{n} $ now replaced by $ N $. 
That is, there is no interpolation. 
This page is numbered 1 in its upper righthand corner, 
making it the first in the subsequence of pages 34, 33, 32, and 31 (Add MS 6782

Harriot explained on the next page (Add MS 6782 
), which is a second version of this one, 
also numbered 1 in its upper righthand corner, 
that one may begin with the formulae on page 34 (Add MS 6782 
), 
then derive the formulae on page 33 (Add MS 6782 
) by replacing $ N $ by $ \frac{N}{n} $. 
That is, one can reverse the sequence of pages 31 to 34. 
As on pages 32 and 33 (Add MS 6782 
 and

the sign charts show how to adapt the formulae to different patterns 
of increasing and decreasing columns.

On this and the following folio (Add MS 6782 
), 
Harriot gives numerical examples of his interpolation method. 
At the top of the page are formulae for $ \frac{N}{n} $  and for $ N $, 
for difference tables with two columns. 
Below that are four examples of tables with two columns.  
The table on the left, with columns headed $ N $, $ B $, $ A $, is interpolated 
first to six, then four, then five times the number of original entries; 
that is, $ n $ takes the values 6, then 4, then 5. 
The symbol * next to the interpolated tables marks entries from the original lefthand table. 
Below the tables, the first column of working uses the formula for $ N $ from the top of the page, 
to obtain the entries 17, 77, and 149 in the difference table on the left. 
The second column of working uses the formula for $ \frac{N}{n} $ from the top of the page, 
to obtain one entry in each of the three remaining difference tables. 
The third column of working presents the converse problem, 
showing how to solve for $ N $ (or $ \frac{N}{n} $ ), 
given values of $ A $ and $ B $ and an entry $ Z $. 
Where the solution is not an integer, Harriot replaces $ N $ by $ \frac{N}{n} $.

This folio gives further numerical examples of interpolation for tables with three columns. 
As on page 35 (Add MS 6782 
), Harriot gives the appropriate $ \frac{N}{n} $ and $ N $ formulae 
at the top of the page. The formula in the first line is from page 33 (Add MS 6782 
), 
while the formulae on the second line are from page 32 (Add MS 6782 
). 
The difference table on the left (headed $ N $, $ C $, $ B $, $ A $) is interpolated 
to five times, and then twice, the number of original entries; 
that is $ n $ takes the values 5 and 2, respectively.  
The working in the first column illustrates the use of the formula for $ N $ 
to calculate values in the left hand table. 
The working in the second column illustrates the use of the formula for $ \frac{N}{n} $ 
to calculate the first new value in the second table (indexed $ \frac{1}{5} $), 
and the third new value in the third table (indexed $ \frac{3}{2} $). 
The working in the third column shows, as on page 35 (Add MS 6782 
), how to find $ \frac{N}{n} $ 
given values of $ A $, $ B $, and $ C $, and an entry $ Z $. 
In this case the working leads to a quadratic equation for  $ N $, 
which Harriot solves by completing the square. 
As on page 35, the solution is not an integer, and so Harriot replaces $ N $ by $ \frac{N}{n} $.

The two lines at the end of the page have nothing to do with the mathematics above them,

is the first line of an epitaph engraved on the tombstone of Edmund Bunny, 
rector of Bolton Percy and canon of York, 
who died in February 1617/8 and was interred in York Minster: 

This is an illustration of synecdoche, in which a part is referred to as the whole; 
thus the pig (lard, here as used to lubricate cobbler's thread) follows the footprints of the iron (needle) 
through the bull (leather); the goose (quill), to whom the cow (inkhorn) provides drink (ink), stains the sheep (skin). 
(The standard version has 
 instead of .) 
 
is an instruction to the student: 'explain and translate'.  
It is possible that  is a play on Percy. 
If the York epitaph was Harriot's source, it gives us a possible date of 1618 for this folio. 

'Bombardagladiofunhastiflammiloquentes'
(Breathing bombs, swords, death, spears, and flames) 
is from a Latin translation by the 16th-century German humanist Martin Crucius of a Greek verse 
(perhaps also by Crucius) consisting of compound words. 
The verse appears in the preface to the  (1583) of Lambert Daneau 
and in the third edition of his  (1592).
The same line appears also in Add MS 6788

In the upper left table, the key column is the one beneath the sketch of a triangular prism. 
The numbers beneath the sketch are those needed to construct triangular prisms 
with length equal to one side of the base:  $ 1 = 1 \times 1 $, $ 6 = 2 \times 3 $, $ 18 = 3 \times 6 $, 
and so on. 
These are also the pentagonal-pyramidal numbers 1, 6, 18, ... as calculated in Add MS 6782 
. 
Successive sums of these numbers are shown in the column to the left headed $ S $ (for sum). 
Successive differences are shown in the columns to the right.

In the upper right table, the key column is the one beneath the sketch of a cube. 
The numbers beneath the sketch are the cube numbers, which can also be thought of 
(in keeping with the previous table) as the numbers needed to construct square prisms 
with height equal to one side of the base: $ 1 = 1 \times 1 $, $ 8 = 2 \times 4 $, $ 27 = 3 \times 9 $, 
and so on. 
Successive sums are shown in the column to the left headed $ S $ (for sum). 
Successive differences are shown in the columns to the right. 
The column beginning 1, 7, 19, 37, ... is marked 'hexagonae equianguli’ (equiangled hexagons); 
it is possible that at first glance Harriot mistook this column for 
the the hexagonal-pyramidal numbers 1, 7, 22, 50, ....

In the lower left table, the key column is the one beneath the sketch of a pentagonal prism. 
The numbers beneath the sketch are the numbers needed to construct pentagonal prisms 
with length equal to one side of the base: $ 1 = 1 \times 1 $, $ 10 = 2 \times 5 $, $ 36 = 3 \times 12 $, 
and so on. 
Successive sums are shown in the column to the left headed $ S $ (for sum). 
Successive differences are shown in the columns to the right.

In the lower right table, the key column is the one beneath the sketch of a hexagonal prism. 
The numbers beneath the sketch are the numbers needed to construct hexagonal prisms 
with length equal to one side of the base: $ 1 = 1 \times 1 $, $ 12 = 2 \times 6 $, $ 45 = 3 \times 15 $, 
and so on. 
Successive sums are shown in the column headed to the left headed $ S $ (for sum). 
Successive differences are shown in the columns to the right.

The formulae at the bottom of the page are for sums of 
triangular, square, pentagonal, and hexagonal prisms. 
Thus the sum of the first two triangular prisms is shown in the upper left table as 1 + 6 = 7. 
The same number may be calculated from the formula $ \frac{3aaaa + 10aaa + 9aa + 2a}{24} $ 
by putting $ a = 2 $. 
For clues as to how Harriot found and tested these formulae, 
see the pages in the map

These three tables show the formulae for the entries in each column of a table generated 
from a constant difference $ e $, with different patterns ofincreasing and decreasing columns. 
Increasing columns are indicated by a triangle that broadens at the bottom, thus, Δ; 
decreasing columns are indicated by a trinagle that narrows at the bottom. 
Entries in the first column (after $ e $) are denoted by $ v^1 $ 
(where 1 is a superscript, not a power). 
Entries in the second column are denoted by $ v^2 $.
Entries in the third column are denoted by $ v^3 $.
Entries in the fourth column are denoted by $ v^4 $.

The rule for the $ n $th entry in the fourth column is given in full, in two different versions. 
Below the double line, similar rules are given for a table in which the first and second columns increase 
but the third and fourth columns decrease.

This folio is a summary of Harriot's calculations on dice. 
The tables on the left, after the page has been turned sideways, 
are frequency tables for the possible sums that can be obtained by throwing 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 dice  
(see Add MS 6782 
 
and 
).
The totals in each case are the appropriate powers of 6. 
The tables on the right are summaries of the tables that appear on Add MS 6782 
, 
and indicate the number of ways repetitions can occur. 
Amongst the calculations at the bottom right are: 
(i) a table that appears to convert hours to £, at £30 per hour. 
(ii) a conversion of 46,656 shillings (one for each possibility for throws of six dice) into £ and shillings. 
Table (i) is based on £30 or 600 shillings per hour; 
converting shillings to throws of the dice, as suggested by table (ii), 
gives 600 throws per hour, or 10 throws per minute.  
(iii) the ratio of throws with repetitions to throws with no repetition, for six dice, 
namely (see the table above), $ 45,936 : 720 = 63\frac{576}{720} : 1 $.

In modern notation, binomes are numbers of the form $ \sqrt{m} + \sqrt{n} $ 
where $ m $ and $ n $ are integers. 
In 
, Euclid defined six kinds of binomes, 
according to various relationships of $ m $ to $ n $, 
which for Euclid were geometric lengths. 
In modern notation, the six binomes may be defined as follows. 
Binome 1: a binome of the form $ m + \sqrt{n} $ with $ m > \sqrt{n} $, 
and $ m^2 = n + k $ where $ \frac{m}{\sqrt{k}} $ is rational; for example $ 7 + \sqrt{48} $. 
Binome 2: a binome of the form $ \sqrt{m} + n $ with $ \sqrt{m} > n $, 
and $ m = n^2 + k $ where $ \frac{\sqrt{m}}{\sqrt{k}} $ is rational; for example $ \sqrt{12} + 3 $. 
Binome 3:  a binome of the form$ \sqrt{m} + \sqrt{n} $ with $ \sqrt{m} > \sqrt{n} $, 
and $ m = n + k $ where $ \frac{\sqrt{m}}{\sqrt{k}} $ is rational; for example $ \sqrt{8} + \sqrt{6} $. 
Binome 4: a binome of the form $ m + \sqrt{n} $ with $ m > \sqrt{n} $, 
and $ m^2 = n + k $ where $ \frac{m}{\sqrt{k}} $ is non-rational; for example $ 2 + \sqrt{2} $. 
Binome 5: a binome of the form $ \sqrt{m} + n $ with $ \sqrt{m} > n $, 
and $ m = n^2 + k $ where $ \frac{\sqrt{m}}{\sqrt{k}} $ is non-rational; for example $ \sqrt{2} + 1 $. 
Binome 6: a binome of the form $ \sqrt{m} + \sqrt{n} $ with $ \sqrt{m} > \sqrt{n} $, 
and $ m = n + k $ where $ \frac{\sqrt{m}}{\sqrt{k}} $ is non-rational; for example $ \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{2} $.  
Harriot made two further distinctions for binomes of the fifth and sixth kind according to whether 
$ k $ is itself a square (type i) or not (type (ii). 
In this and the following folio, Add MS 6782 
, 
Harriot shows that the square of any binome is always a binome of the first kind. 
This folio shows his working for first, second, and third binomes.

Powers of $ (b + c) $ up to $ (b + c)^5 $. 
Each power is calculated from the previous one by multiplication.

On this folio Harriot gives rules for finding all the parameters of an arithmetic progression 
given any three of them. 
The three parameters supposed given are listed in the second column, headed 'data',

Rules for finding the two remaining quantities in each case are given in the third column, headed 'quaesita'.

Here Harriot works on the same equation, written as $ aaa = 2.3aa + 400 $. See also Add MS 6782

The letters SWL that appear in this page refer to Harriot's friend Sir William Lower.

On this first page, Harriot works out the multiplications  
$ (a - b)(a - c)(a - d) $, $ (a - b)(a - c)(a + d) $, $ (a - b)(a + c)(a + d) $, 
$ (aa - bb)(a - d) $, $ (aa - bb)(a - d) $, $ (aa + bb)(a - d) $. 
In each case he writes down the values of $ a $ that reduce the resulting product to zero.  
For the second multiplication, for instance, he shows that the product becomes zero when $ a = b $ and $ a = c $ 
but not when $ a = d $.

A continuation from Add MS 6782 
 of work on the equation arising from the multiplication 
$ (a - b)(a - c)(a + d) $. 
Harriot states without proof the special form the equation will take when $ d = b + c $, 
when the term in $ aa $ vanishes. For a full derivation see Add MS 6783 
 (d.3). 
Harriot calls this form of the cubic equation an 'elliptic' or 'Bombellian' equation. 
The special case where $ b = c $ he calls 'parabolic'. 
For Harriot's definitions of the hyperbolic, elliptic, and parabolic forms 
of a cubic equation without a square term, see Add MS 6783 
 (e.8). 
On this page Harriot also gives the form the equation will take when $ bc = bd + cd $, 
when the term in $ a $ vanishes. For a full derivation see Add MS 6783 
 (d.3).

This page is a continuation of Add MS 6783

Note 3 gives the triangular numbers in general algebraic notation: 
$ \frac{n}{1} $, $ \frac{n(n + 1)}{1 \times 2} $, $ \frac{n(n + 1)(n + 2)}{1 \times 2 \times 3} $, 
$ \frac{n(n + 1)(n + 2)(n + 3)}{1 \times 2 \times 3 \times 4} $. 
On the right these formula are given labels that in modern subscript notation would be 
$ p_1 $, $ p_2 $, $ p_3 $, and so on. 
In the fourth notation, in the lower half of the page, 
 has been replaced by , 
and the terms have been multiplied out to give a one-line expression (or in Harriot's terms, an equation) 
instead of a fraction.

These are the symbols Harriot devised in 1585 for writing down the native Indian language of Algonquin. 
In the right-hand column there are 12 vowels followed by 24 consonants. 
In the left-hand column are words representing each sound. 
The sounds and then the words are transcribed here from Harriot's notes on another copy of this page, 
now held at Westminster School, London, and reproduced in 
.

This page refers to Aristotle's , Books V and VI, 
where Aristotle defines what it means for things to be together or apart, in contact, or continuous. 
The definitions may be paraphrased as follows:

Things are said to be together if they are in one place, apart if they are in different places. 
Things are said to be in contact if their extremities are together. 
Things are said to be continuous if the touching limits of each become one and the same.

The equation on this page has a 3-digit solution. The first digit is found by inspection to be 2 ($ b = 200 $). 
The second digit, is found to be 4 ($ c = 40 $). 
The process is now repeated, treating $ b + c $ as a single quantity, to find the third digit, again labelled $ c $. 
This is found to be 3.

This is the first of a set of 12 pages on extracting roots of positively affected equations, 
that is, equations where all the powers following the first are positive. 
Such equations have one, and only one, positive root. 
The work is closely based on Problems 1 to 6 of 
Viète's  
;  
Harriot's heading 'De numerosa potestatum resolutione' directly echoes Viète's.  
The method works by finding each digit of the root in turn. 
Suppose that a required root $ a $ of is of the form $ b + c $, 
where $ b $ represents multiples of 10 and $ c $ represents units.  
The first digit is found by inspection. The canonical form then shows how to estimate $ c $. 
In the problem on this page, for example, Harriot first takes $ b $ to be 40, but quickly finds that this is too large. 
Therefore $ b $ must be 30. Subtracting the known values of $ bb $ (= 900) and $ bd $ (= 720) from 2356 
leaves him with 736, which according to the canonical form must correspond to $ 2bc + cd + cc $. 
A first estimate for $ c $ is found by dividing 736 by $ 2b + d $ (= 84). The integer part of the quotient is 8. 
In fact $ c = 8 $ satisfies the equation $ 2bc + cd + cc = 736 $ exactly and so the process is complete. 
Later examples become more complicated but follow the same basic procedure.

On this page Harriot begins a general treatment of equations of the form $ xxxz = ddda - adaa $, 
with no cube or square term. 
In order to preserve dimensions, $ xxxz $ is used as a placeholder for a general 4-dimensional quantity; 
similarly $ ddd $ is a placeholder for a 3-dimensional quantity, not necessarily a cube. 
All coefficients are assumed to be positive. 
Equations of this kind have two positive roots or none at all, depending on the size of $ xxxz $.

Following from the general treatment in Add MS 6782 
, 
, of avulsed cubics with no linear term, 
Harriot here solves the equation  $ 24300 = 57aa - aaa $ for both roots ($ a = 30 $, $ a = 45 $). 
He also shows how either root may be obtained from the other.   
The equation is taken from Problem 18 of Viète, 
 
. 
Viète gave rules for the relationship between the two roots but did not explain how he had arrived at them. 
This page demonstrates clearly two kinds of canonical forms used by Harriot in this treatise. 
The first, the 'canonical form for unequal roots' is the general form of an avulsed cubic without a linear term; 
in this case $ b $ and $ c $ are the two positive roots of the equation.  
The second, the 'canonical form for the solution' is the form arrived at by assuming the root $ a $ 
takes the form $ 10b + c $, that is, $ b $ is the first integer in the solution, $ c $ the second. 
Thus the meanings of $ b $ and $ c $ in the two forms are quite different.

On this page Harriot begins a general treatment of equations of the form $ xxz = dda - aaa $, 
with no square term. To preserve dimensions, $ xxz $ is used as a placeholder for a general 3-dimensional quantity; 
similarly $ dd $ is a placeholder for a 2-dimensional quantity, not necessarily a square. 
All coefficients are assumed to be positive. 
Equations of this kind have two positive roots or none at all, depending on the size of $ xxz $.

On that page, as an example, he calculated limits for the two positive roots of the equation $ 9261 = 370 - aa $. 
On this page he solves the same equation fully for both roots.  
The equation is taken from Problem 16 of Viète's

Viète gave rules for the relationship between the two roots but did not explain how he had arrived at them.

This is the first of a set of 18 pages on extracting roots of avulsed equations, 
that is, equations containing three terms, in which the term of highest degree is subtracted 
(torn away, or 'avulsed') from the term of next higest degree.  
Such equations have two positive roots. It is therefore important to know the relative sizes of the roots 
before beginning extraction by numerical methods. This is the problem Harriot investigated in this section. 
The work is closely based on Problems 16 to 20 in 
Viète, , 
. 
Viète gave rules for finding the second positive root once the first is known, but without explanation. 
In this section, Harriot fills in the missing details, showing how the two positive roots 
are related to the coefficients of the original equation and to each other. 
For a general explanation of the method of extraction see Add MS 6782 
.

Viète used the letter $ B $ for the difference between the two lines,

$ F $ to $ B $ for the ratio of the second part to the second line, 
$ H $ for the gvien difference,

Harriot worked through the three cases given by Viète, using his own notation.

This is the first of several pages in which Harriot worked on Zetetica 7 to 10 from Book I of Viète's 
 
. 
Harriot at first treated the problems exactly as Viète had done, using the geometric language in which the word 
 represents an unknown line, side, or root. 
However, in each case Harriot then switched from geometry to arithmetic, 
treating the known and unknown quantities as numbers rather than geometrical quantities.

This page contains Harriot's working of Zetetic 7.

Viète used the letter $ B $ for the whole line, 
$ D $ to $ B $ for the ratio of the first part to the first segment, 
$ F $ to $ B $ for the ratio of the second part to the second segment, 
$ H $ for the prescribed sum, 
and $ A $ and $ E $ for the parts of the first and second segments. 
Harriot repeated Viète's working in his own notation, and also added some variants of his own. 
The numbers at the bottom of the page are taken from Viète. 
On Add MS 6782 
, Harriot worked the same problem with further numerical examples.

Thus, $ a = b $ is to be read as '$ a - b $ or $ b - a $, whichever is positive'. 
In modern notation the same result is represented by $ |a - b| $.

This page contains a lemma needed for Zetetic 10 from Book II of Viète's

Viète called the given side $ D $, and the side to be found $ A - \frac{1}{2}D $, 
and arrived at the following conclusion: 

Borrowing Viète's notation, his statement may be written as the identity 
$ (A - \frac{1}{2}D)^2 + D^2 + (DA - \frac{1}{2}D^2) = A^2 $. 
On this page Harriot investigated the problem geometrically. 
On Add MS 6782

This page is one of the few that contains a date: 29 August 1600. 
The date is consistent with the suggestion that Harriot's friend Nathaniel Torporley met Viète in person 
in Paris in the late 1590s, and brought Viète's books back to England (see 
. 
This appears to be the first of several pages in which Harriot worked systematically through Viète's
 
, 
re-writing the propositions and proofs in his own notation. 
He began here with Zetetics 2 and 3 from Book 1 
; 
Zetetic 1 is sketched in outline on Add MS 6782 
. 
He reached the end of Book I nine days later on 6 September (see Add MS 6782 
.)

Viète used the letters $ A $ and $ E $ for the two roots, and $ R $ to $ S $ for their ratio. 
Harriot repeated Viète's working in his own notation.

This is also Proposition II.9 from the  of Diophantus,

One may interpret the problem as asking for two sets of Pythagorean triples with the same third side,

Viète called the sides of the first two squares $ B $ and $ D $, and the hypotenuse $ Z $. 
The words 'synæreseos' and 'diæreseos' were used by Viète and are typical of the Greek terms 
he frequently introduced into his writing.
